Book module template viewer and editor for Adobe Lightroom 6

The book module in Adobe Lightroom comes with a defined set of page layout 
templates with no way of modifying them. The layouts are defined in lua
structures in plain text, making it possible to add your own custom ones.

This tool is bourne of a desire to tweak some existing layouts and create
a couple of new ones. The aim of the first iterations is for an assisted 
text editor, with aids in creating a custom page layout and visualising
the templates. The end goal would be WYSIWYG editing of layouts.
